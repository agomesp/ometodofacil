<span style="font-size:larger;">**N√ÉO PULE CAP√çTULOS**</span>

Essa √© uma vers√£o [reescrita](https://sites.google.com/site/hackbookeasypeasy)  do hackbook adaptando o livro *Allen Carr's EasyWay to Stop Smoking* para a pornografia. √â tamb√©m **completamente livre** e [open source](https://gitlab.com/snuggy/easypeasy). N√£o sou o autor original de nenhum desses dois livros. Sou o Hackauthor¬≤.

√â efetivo, mas para que tenha sucesso √© necessario que voc√™:

<span style="font-size:larger;">**N√ÉO PULE CAP√çTULOS**</span>

Ao abrir um cofre voc√™ deve digitar os n√∫meros na ordem correta.
V√≠cio n√£o √© diferente disso.

Pessoalmente, a [vers√£o original no Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/hackbookeasypeasy) (que n√£o foi escrita por mim) mudou minha vida. Se voc√™ √© como a maioria das pessoas, acabou descobrindo a pornografia quando era bem jovem e passou a utilizar desde ent√£o. At√© se deparar com a chocante -- e ainda censurada -- pesquisas alertando sobre os riscos. Como eu, voc√™ teve sucesso com diversos per√≠odos de abstin√™ncia de diversos tamanhos mas sempre recaiu com desejos fortes e ilus√≥rios. Sinto prazer em dizer que esse m√©todo funciona totalmente diferente e tem sido o √∫nico m√©todo que tem funcionado.

Or perhaps, you've been linked this book by a concerned party and are skeptical. Firstly, thank you for at least looking at it. This will be expanded upon shortly, but please briefly recall the first time you looked at pornography. Did you expect that you'd return to it for the rest of your life? According to my own informal studies on the matter (pestering friends to read this book), EasyPeasy is equally as effective for the casual porn user as it is for the heavily addicted. It's not terribly long, with high chances of large gains, so I beg you to continue reading.

The method described in this hackbook is:

-   Instantaneous.

-   Equally as effective for the heavy and casual user alike.

-   Causes no bad withdrawal pangs.

-   Needs no willpower.

-   Requires no shock treatment, aids, or gimmicks.

-   Won't cause you to replace this addiction with other addictions, such as overeating, smoking or drinking.

-   Permanent.

You might find this impossible to believe, but this sentiment is echoed by many people.

> "*This book is gold. It's unbelievable I can access this content for free, this simple book with less than 100 pages. It's also unbelievable how much money I've spent on courses and how many hows wasted digging r/nofap for 0 results*"

> "*I was addicted for 10 years. Those 10 years I was crippled with depression, doubt, anxiety, and fear of my secret getting out. After every session, I hated myself, and after every porn diet I was back down the water slide in no time. However, this book helped me stop. I was always on the defensive against porn in the past. Now, after reading this book twice, I am on the offensive. Porn has no control over me and feels like a sad joke now.*"

Allen Carr is a top bloke with an exceedingly interesting life: a hundred-a-day chain smoker for over thirty years, Carr stopped immediately after discovering *EasyWay*, and as quoted from his book, this "*enabled him to follow an overwhelming desire to explain his method to as many smokers as possible.*" His methods for alcohol, other drugs, and many other addictions remain global bestsellers and I'd encourage you to check them out.

His body of work deals with dispelling fear caused by misconceptions and confusion regarding biological processes and quitting. Therefore a majority of the book is spent logically deconstructing anxieties and phobias associated with quitting that generally lead to the downfall of many who attempt and fail. Carr's clinics have success rates of over ninety-five percent, with money-back guarantees. More importantly, they've allowed their patients to go on to live fulfilling lives free of their addictions.

Why the hackbook? Because Allen Carr has long since passed away and the institutions he's formed don't list internet pornography as one of the addictions they provide treatment for. I don't gain monetarily or otherwise.

<span style="font-size:smaller;">**Hackbook:** A book based and hacked from another book. The original author is fully credited. </span>

Throughout this book, myself, the original Hackauthor, and Allen Carr will appear transparently in order to provide you with a unique and compelling method to easily and painlessly quit.

<span style="font-size:larger;">**Tips for reading:**</span>

**Don't read this book like a normal book**, it's very short, and you should be able to finish it within a couple of hours. Most people benefit from *highlighting or taking notes*, and usually recommend **rereading** it a few times to fully solidify the lessons.

A number of communities exist for the hackbook as well, but would recommend checking them out only after you've finished reading the book.

Quick reminder:

<span style="font-size:larger;">**DO NOT JUMP CHAPTERS**</span>

I'd wish you luck, but as you'll soon come to learn, you don't need it.

Good vibes,
